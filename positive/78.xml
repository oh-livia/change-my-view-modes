<title>CMV: The highest form of relationship between men and women doomed to be romance</title>

Maybe <premise>it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex</premise>, but <claim>I'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.</claim>


<premise>"Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?"</premise> I wonder (<claim>my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss's *The Game*</claim>). "<premise>Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more?</premise> <premise>Why can't I be friends with girls (even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I don't try to advance some romantic agenda?</premise> <premise>Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them?</premise>"


<claim>I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships</claim>, but <premise>instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read</premise>, <premise>I ask just the one title question</premise> (thinking that the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding) because <claim>I want to know what older, more mature people think</claim>. <claim>It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.</claim>


At times, <claim>I feel like the interplay between men and women is always (at least always initially) a bs game</claim> where <premise>the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner</premise>. <premise>Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me</premise> that <claim>I can't stand it</claim>. Please change this view.

Id just like to point out that <claim>this has never remotely seemed the case from my perspective as a lesbian</claim>. Beyond that, <claim>there are many people who want close relationships without romance</claim>, <premise>an obvious example would be asexual people</premise>. <premise>They can have close relationships that rival that of marriage</premise>, but <premise>how would you even quantify that</premise>? <premise>How can you even compare them?</premise> <premise>What about the relationship of a brother and sister?</premise>

If you <premise>limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women</premise>, then <claim>maybe you're right</claim>, but then again <premise>who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple?  </premise>

The bottom line is that <claim>people are different from you</claim> can <claim>relationships are hard to compare</claim>. <premise>Maybe for you, every relationship with a woman is motivated by romance.</premise> <premise>For someone other hetero guy it might not be.</premise> <claim>Sexual attraction is not something that just shuts off</claim> so even if <premise>you're in a lifelong comitted closed relationship</premise> <premise>you'll still probably feel attraction for other people</premise>. <claim>Thats just reality for most people</claim>, and <claim>its not necesarily harmful and its not really shallow.</claim>

<claim>There are very few absolutes when it comes to interpersonal relationships.</claim>

In short, <premise>I don't need to feel guilty when I'm attracted to people I know I can't have?</premise> Maybe <premise>I'm too black-and-white</premise> to think that <claim>the murmurs of my id are natural and not evil</premise>.

As for which relationship is *higher* from a quantifiable standpoint, <claim>I see what you mean</claim>.<premise> When I said highest, I meant it not from a perspective of quantity of some sort</premise>, but of <premise>a level of worth</premise>. Looking at that statement, however, <claim>I think you're right</claim> again--<premise>who is to put a romantic relationship above a friendship?</premise> 

<premise>It's a bit extreme and morbid</premise>, but <premise>if I were to put someone's spouse and someone's absolute best friend in front of a train and gave that person one to save, whom would they save?</premise> Maybe I just find that <premise>once I reach a certain threshold with a guy-friend, I find that we become best friends</premise>, but <premise>when I reach that threshold with a girl-friend, I find that I want more</premise>. Maybe <premise>I haven't been around the block enough or had enough female friends to feel this way</premise>. <premise>I don't have any lesbian friends (as far as I know at least)</premise>, so <claim>I don't know how I would react to being great friends with one.</claim>
