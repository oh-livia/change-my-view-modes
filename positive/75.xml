<title>CMV: I feel skill is largely determined by experience. Compliments on skill are almost meaningless.</title>

<OP author="skier_scott">
In high school, <claim>I thought I was "good at math" as I'm the son of a math teacher and electrical engineer</claim>. In college, I learned that <claim>math was not something you're "good at" but something you have to put hard work into and is almost the sole determiner in the level of skill you obtain</claim>.

<claim>So then isn't almost any compliment almost to be expected?</claim> <premise>I've spent a lot of time with similar problems</premise> -- <premise>how could I not know all the details and little tricks of these problems?</premise>

<claim>I feel a compliment recognizes something given</claim>: <claim>I feel everyone is passionate about something</claim>, <premise>whether it be math or psychology or medicine</premise> (<premise>I don't hear "you're so good at biology"</premise> but <claim>I think I should</claim>).

<premise>Then wouldn't a complement be just an acknowledgement of the time and effort you put into something that most people see as hard or worthwhile? </premise> <claim>This implies the complement is meaningful.</claim>

(<claim>Most people don't do this</claim> - either <premise>they don't put the time and effort into something generally hard or worthwhile</premise> or <premise>the time and effort isn't hard or worthwhile</premise>.)

<claim>When I receive a compliment I should publicly recognize that then, right?</claim> <premise>No only am I accepting their compliment</premise>, <premise>I'm showing some of what I truly believe.</premise>

That counts as a &amp;#8710;!
