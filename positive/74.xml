<title>CMV: Swimming is the best form of exercise</title>

<OP author="Helicase21">
While <claim>obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being</claim>, if <premise>someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique</premise>, <claim>there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming</claim>. Swimming is:

A) <premise>cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels</premise>

B) <premise>resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added</premise>

C) <premise>low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems</premise>

D) <premise>whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)</premise>

With all that said and considered, is there any reason to choose another **single** form of exercise over swimming, other than lack of accessible facilities (EDIT: or physical inability to swim)?

Edit 2: view changed, because <claim>"best form of exercise" is actually meaningless</claim>.

<claim>Exercise regimens depend entirely on your goals.</claim> <premise>Do you want to improve your cardiovascular health?</premise> <claim>Cardio</claim>. <premise>Do you want to work on aesthetics?</premise> <claim>Weights</claim>. <premise>Do you want to increase your physical strength?</premise> <claim>Weights</claim>. <premise>Best in terms of time investment?</premise> <claim>Weights</claim>. <premise>Best in terms of monetary investment?</premise> <claim>Walking</claim>. <claim>People have different goals</claim>, <premise>some thing running a marathon is the pinnacle of fitness</premise>, <premise>others think 5 plate deads are a better example of fitness</premise>, and <premise>others think aesthetics is all that matter</premise>. 

&gt;able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances

<claim>Every exercise I can think of can be done *at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances*.</claim>

&gt;resistance in many muscle groups

<premise>Eventually though you'll stop making strength gains and simply be increasing your endurance.</premise> <claim>This is the fundamental problem with all body-weight exercises.</claim>

&gt;low-impact

<claim>Best for people with issues != best for people without issues or best overall.</claim>

&gt;whole-body 

While <claim>it's important to workout your whole body</claim>, <claim>there is a reason that most weight-lifting routines isolate different areas</claim>, <premise>very few routines are whole body in 1 day</premise>.

&gt;another single form of exercise over swimming

If you mean a single exercise like a specific lift, I have to ask, which single method of swimming are you talking about? <premise>If you mean a single type of exercise</premise>, <claim>weight lifting is by far the best</claim>.

<premise>As far as single lifts go</premise>, <claim>the squat is often referred to as one of the best</claim>. <premise>It helps with flexibility</premise>, and <premise>works your legs and core quite hard</premise>. <claim>It's also the most beneficial for older people</claim> since <premise>so much of their lives revolve around getting in and out of chairs</premise> (<premise>there's an entire article I read about this once</premise>).

<claim>Best regimen just depends on your goals</claim>. That said, <claim>I think some of the better weight lifting routines are more efficient at achieving just about any goal you can think of, except cardiovascular endurance.</claim>

thank you, you've âˆ†'d my view by pointing out that <claim>'best form of exercise' is pretty much meaningless</claim>.
