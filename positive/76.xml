<title>CMV: Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system.</title>

<OP author="SouthernGlenfidditch">
<premise>As I understand it</premise>, and <premise>crudely explained</premise>, SVT says that <premise>in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour</premise>, <claim>waste has to be produced in order for the system to function</claim>.

Example: <premise>Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.</premise> <premise>The boss owns the factory where the workers work</premise>, and <premise>they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy</premise>. <premise>The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day</premise>. <premise>At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500</premise>. <premise>Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each.</premise> <premise>She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls</premise>, but <premise>the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500</premise>. <premise>No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls</premise>, and so <premise>the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.</premise>

<premise>This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same</premise>: if <premise>each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit</premise>, then <claim>items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.</claim>

<premise>Most people aren't paid on commission</premise>, so <claim>this isn't really a good example</claim>, but <claim>I think I get where you're going with it. </claim>

&gt;if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce

<claim>But the money doesn't just disappear.</claim>  For one thing, <premise>you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't "produce" anything.</premise>  You're also neglecting that <premise>when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.  </premise>

Since <premise>whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money</premise>, <claim>there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced</claim>.  <premise>This value may not be the price being charged for the thing</premise>, and <claim>that's where supply and demand are involved</claim>.  

I'm not going to deny that <premise>sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it</premise>, but <claim>that's more a failure of the system than the system itself</claim>.  <claim>The same goes for when something is priced above its market value</claim>, <premise>it won't sell and will be waste</premise>, but that's because <premise>the seller overpriced it</premise>, <premise>not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.</premise>

<claim>No ideal system is really going to be inefficient</claim>, <claim>its the real ones that have problems.</claim>  

If <premise>you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient</premise>, then <claim>no one is going to dispute you</claim>, but I will point out that <claim>it's the most efficient real system we have</claim>.

That makes a lot of sense! Thank you! I can accept that <claim>it would be a wasteless system if there were multiple factories and the boss spent all of their money! </claim>

I can definitely think of other bits of inefficiency but that wasn't the question so nevermind! :)
