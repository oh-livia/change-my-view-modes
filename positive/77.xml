<title>CMV: Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system.</title>

<OP author="SouthernGlenfidditch">
<premise>As I understand it</premise>, and <premise>crudely explained</premise>, SVT says that <premise>in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour</premise>, <claim>waste has to be produced in order for the system to function</claim>.

Example: <premise>Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.</premise> <premise>The boss owns the factory where the workers work</premise>, and <premise>they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy</premise>. <premise>The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day</premise>. <premise>At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500</premise>. <premise>Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each.</premise> <premise>She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls</premise>, but <premise>the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500</premise>. <premise>No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls</premise>, and so <premise>the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.</premise>

<premise>This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same</premise>: if <premise>each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit</premise>, then <claim>items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.</claim>

<claim>This is one of those views that likes to view production, capital, labor, and all of economics as a zero sum game.</claim> <claim>It's not.</claim> <claim>Money circulates multiple times in a system</claim>, and <claim>value is created at each stage</claim>. 

I.e. <claim>you're simplifying it down to a level where it doesn't show all of the uses of the money that actually happen</claim>. 

<claim>I could reduce this down to the absolute simplest case and thus reduce the entire argument to absurdity</claim>: <premise>a single worker, who owns all of his own tools (that he made himself), makes a doll out of parts he gathers or makes at no cost to himself</premise>. <premise>The doll is worth $10.</premise> But since <premise>no one in this system actually has $10</premise>, <premise>no one can buy that doll</premise>, and therefore <claim>it goes to waste</claim>. 

Do you see why this reasoning breaks down because <claim>it leaves out a lot of economic activity outside of the example shown</claim>? <claim>Nothing about scaling that up to a factory changes the reasoning</claim>. <claim>The reasoning is just oversimplified and wrong</claim>. 

In reality, <claim>all of the money received by the factory for the dolls goes to someone</claim>. One problem is that <premise>typically most companies aren't owned by the "bosses"</premise>. <premise>They are owned by the owners of the company, which are many and varied, often including the workers in many cases</premise>. <premise>The excess value goes to all of them, who spend it on many things</premise>.

Of perhaps <premise>some of it is retained as capital by the owners</premise>. But <premise>what does that really mean?</premise> <claim>People don't actually "horde" money in couches.</claim> <premise>They invest it in other productive stuff, such as new factories that produce *more* stuff (someone has to pay the people that build the factories)</premise>, or <premise>money that is borrowed by people to start their own businesses</premise>. 

Now, yes, <premise>some businesses fail</premise>, and <claim>that is by and large where most of the "surplus value" is "wasted"</claim>. But <claim>only in a very narrow sense</claim>, because <premise>in the process of being "wasted", it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases, payrolls, etc</premise>. Additionally, <premise>the businesses that succeed end up generating *more* economic activity.</premise> 

<claim>This is no different from any other system</claim>, BTW. <premise>In communism, surplus value is also either created </premise>(or, alternately and more likely, a <premise>shortage occurs because not enough was produced</premise>). <claim>The only difference is where the money goes</claim>. 

In <premise>real-world examples of communist states</premise>, <claim>the money goes to the state</claim>, which <premise>"wastes" a lot of it in overhead and useless production</premise> as well. Or <premise>in some kinds of communism</premise>, <claim>it goes back to the workers</claim>.

Another problem with your view is that <claim>factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory, and a lot of incentive to not *create* excess inventory in the first place</claim>. <premise>Other systems have less incentive for these corrections to happen</premise>, and as a practical matter <claim>end up generating even more waste</claim>, because <premise>the people making the decisions about production don't have as much incentive to get those decisions right</premise>.

Already gave this triangle to someone else but wanted to give it to you too if that's allowed. Great answer, thank you!
