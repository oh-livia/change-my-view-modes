<title>CMV: I think the Paris shooting makes a good case for culture of responsible gun ownership any carrying.</title>

Thinking about today's news: [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-30710777), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting)

  <claim> I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this. </claim> <logos> <pathos> There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. </pathos> </logos> <logos> <pathos> These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. </pathos> </logos> <claim> I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). </claim>

<claim> I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. </claim> <logos> Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse </logos>, and <logos> society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries </logos>. <claim> I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights </claim> <logos> as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the "not one of us" (pack) mentality and escalation of "police state" </logos>.
Change my view.

PS: I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.

EDIT: Awarded a delta to a comment which didn't refute this idea but led me to change my view that it would be best realized with paralyzing weapons rather then guns: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnr30/cmv_i_think_the_paris_shooting_makes_a_good_case/cni3o83

Scenario 1:

<pathos> Let's say you're a drug addict and due to your addiction you can't hold down a job, are really strung out and resort to one of the stupidest ways to make $100 for your next fix which is mugging people on the street. </pathos> <claim> Not getting the money is not an option </claim> <logos> <pathos> because you're desperate </pathos> </logos>.

<pathos> If one in 10,000 people are carrying firearms, do you take your chances and try to get someone to hand over their cash without shooting someone or do you kill them outright and steal their valuables off their corpse? </pathos>

  <pathos> How does that decision change when the odds are 1 in 5? </pathos>

  <pathos> Remember, you're an addict and not getting the money is not an option. </pathos>


Scenario 2:

  <pathos> You're carrying and you rear end a guy. </pathos> <pathos> You pull over and the guy is really mad and he gets out of his car yelling up a storm. </pathos> <pathos> You know there is a 1 in 5 chance that the guy is carrying as well. </pathos> <pathos> When do you reach for your holster to draw your weapon </pathos> and <pathos> when do you fire it? </pathos>

  1. <pathos> When he's angry and yelling at you? </pathos>

  2. <pathos> When he reaches into his jacket where his holster might be? </pathos>

  3. <pathos> After you see the gun? </pathos>

  4. <pathos> After he points it at you? </pathos>

  5. <pathos> After he starts shooting? </pathos>

Scenario 3:

  <pathos> You're carrying </pathos> and <pathos> you just picked your brand new car up from the dealer </pathos> and <pathos> while you were at the stoplight some asshole that was obviously texting while driving rear ends you in your brand new car </pathos>. <pathos> You lose your temper and get out of your brand new car yelling up a storm. </pathos> <pathos> You notice after a bit of yelling that the guy is carrying </pathos> and <pathos> he has observed that you are as well and is scared </pathos>.

  <pathos> Do you wait until you're sure he has decided to use his firearm to act? </pathos> or <pathos> do you act first because by the time you're sure he is going to draw his firearm, you won't have time to act before he shoots you? </pathos>

  <claim> The only reason this stuff doesn't happen all the time is </claim> <logos> because we can make the reasonable assumption that a person we are having a conflict with is unarmed </logos>. <logos> As soon as it becomes a reasonable assumption, immediately escalating a conflict to deadly force starts being the best option. </logos>

<pathos> <ethos> I've worked in customer service and have been yelled at by strangers more often than anyone should have. </ethos> </pathos> <pathos> <logos> If I lived in a society where most people were carrying firearms, I would have had to ask myself "Is this person angry enough to kill me? because if I wait to find out for sure I'll already be dead" way more often than I'd like. </logos> </pathos>

Scenario 1: <claim> I don't think this decision changes if you are comfortable killing for money </claim> <logos> you kill for money if you can get away with it </logos>.

  Scenario 2: <claim> When he starts to pulling out a gun you try to get cover </claim>, <claim> when he starts aiming at you you draw to fire </claim>. 

Scenario 3: <logos> The known rule would be only to draw gun to shoot and who is aiming at you is aiming at you to shoot </logos> so <claim> you are in right to defend yourself </claim> . <claim> If you are unsure of someone's intentions you should get cover </claim> and <claim> as soon he notices that and doesn't intend to kill you he should make this well known to you </claim> as <logos> he doesn't you to shoot him either </logos>.

  <claim> You'd likely be dead in scenarios 2 and 3. </claim> <pathos> This isn't the movies where you duck bullets and dive behind a table or something. </pathos> <logos> By the time they have their hand on their gun you have maybe 2 seconds, and by the time they start aiming it at you, you have a fraction of one. </logos> <logos> There is a reason why police, when they have reason to believe that someone is armed have their guns already drawn. </logos> <pathos> <logos> That shit happens fast, and reactive speed isn't fast enough. </logos> </pathos>

As for scenario 1, <claim> once you remove the non-lethal option, the lethal one gets a lot more comfortable </claim>.

<reply id="cnhr8ff" author="rrockethr">
  <claim> Yes </claim>, but <claim> I don't see how you intend to CMV with the scenarios 2 and 3 </claim>. <logos> I don't see them as very likely as nobody is going to draw a concealed gun when not intending to kill. </logos>

With scenario 1 <claim> I would expect the effect would be that the still thinking criminals would change to some other safer crime </claim> as <logos> their chances of getting shot would also increase </logos>. <logos> It would still be illegal to kill a robber </logos> so <claim> I don't think some of them would start killing </claim> (<logos> thus being legal to kill in defense </logos>).

<reply id="cnhrsbb" author="cold08">
  <claim> Of course you intend to kill the person if you draw your weapon, if you can reasonably assume that they have a weapon, </claim> <pathos> <logos> you can't wait for them to draw theirs before you decide to defend yourself if you want to leave alive </logos> </pathos>. <logos> <pathos> All you know in all three scenarios is that someone you are in conflict with probably has a gun and there is a significant chance they will use it. </pathos> </logos>

<claim> If you don't have reasonable cause to believe someone is armed because very few people have CCWs then things like letting the guy you just rear ended blow off steam becomes a reasonable option </claim> <logos> because he likely can't kill you within in a few seconds </logos>.

<pathos> <logos> If 1 in 5 people can kill you in seconds being impolite gets deadly very quickly. </logos> </pathos>

  Well <claim> I don't think so </claim> , <logos> people with concealed guns don't shoot even if they see someone has a gun too </logos>.
