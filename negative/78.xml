<title>CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...</title>

<claim>The options are as follows</claim>:

1. <claim>You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.</claim>

2. <claim>You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure. </claim>

3. <claim>You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.</claim>


Reasoning: <premise>I used to follow 'option number 3', but recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values.</premise> <claim>I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however</claim>, so feel free to prove me wrong.

What about Option 4: <claim>You hate animals and you want to see them killed.</claim>

<claim>View. Changed.</claim>

<premise>Shall we rule out sociopathy/psychopathy?</premise>

<claim>Hmm maybe if it makes it easier for you</claim>. Although <claim>I can imagine someone that has empathy for humans but none for other animals.</claim>

<claim>Good point</claim>, although <claim>I regard that as speciesism. </claim>

<claim>I do have a Christian friend who is extremely charitable</claim>. <premise>She's a carer, a foster mother and a complete romantic who writes novels about angels.</premise> <premise>She 's obviously an all-round good and kind person</premise>, but <premise>she eats meat</premise>.

<claim>I rationalise this</claim> by realising that <claim>helping people is her passion</claim>, and <premise>perhaps her religion justifies a moral distinction between humans and non-human animals</premise>. <premise>Doesn't the Bible claim something along the lines of that animals were created for the enjoyment of humans</premise> (<premise>I haven't read it myself</premise>)?

To address your last question, yes, <claim>the bible states that all animals were put on earth by God to serve man</claim>. <claim>There were rules against eating certain kinds</claim>, but <claim>overall the idea was that humans have dominion over all</claim>. In which case, <claim>there is no cognitive dissonance</claim>, but <claim>this would probably fall under your 2nd line of reasoning</claim>.

<claim>Yes, speciesism is indeed the norm</claim> and <claim>I appreciate you taking the time to comment</claim>. <claim>I asked this question so as to keep myself grounded in what other justifications my loved ones around me didn't have the same epiphany I did</claim> (<premise>as it may not necessary be the same reasons I had for not going vegan sooner</premise>).

&gt;I mean hell, it's hard enough for many people to empathize with each other, and you're asking them to try to put themselves in the hooves of a cow? It's just beyond the scope for many people unless they seriously put the time in to think about it, and they've got their own lives to worry about.

<claim>A very good reminder, thank you</claim>. <claim>Not everyone is as obsessed with philosophy, psychology and nature as I am</claim>, <premise>just as I don't concern myself with keeping extremely up to date on world politics and Amnesty International petitions.</premise>

<claim>I'd still class it as option 3 though</claim> :P
