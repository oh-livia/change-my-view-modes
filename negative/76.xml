<title>CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...</title>

<OP author="Anticarnist">
<claim>The options are as follows:</claim>

<claim>1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.</claim>

<claim>2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure. </claim>

<claim>3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.</claim>


Reasoning: <premise>I used to follow 'option number 3', but recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values.</premise> <claim>I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic</claim> however, so feel free to prove me wrong.

<claim>There is a 4th choice.</claim>  <claim>You can choose to not anthropomorphize animals, and, <premise>despite how much you love your dog</premise>, realize that a chicken is just a chicken</claim>, and that <claim>your farmed tilapia doesn't have the cognition to question whether it's life is worth living.</claim>

<claim>I want the animals to be raised humanely</claim>, and, yes, <claim>I want them to be killed humanely</claim>.  But <premise>it's not like a wild turkey sits on it's deathbed and thinks fondly of those days gone by, when it roamed free and raised its baby turkeys.</premise>  <claim>No, it thinks more "food?  sex?  food?".</claim>

<premise>Yes, they feel pain, but so does an earthworm, if you mean "experience messages that say 'bad things are happening - endeavor to stop them'".  </premise><premise>They don't look back and say, "Man, remember when I bumped into that electric fence?  That hurt like hell."</premise> <claim> The best they can manage is "Fence.  Bad."</claim>

<premise>There is no "meaningful" or "meaningless" life for an animal - they don't philosophize beyond needs. </premise> <premise>Most farm animals spend less time hungry, scratched by brambles, running from predators, etc than wild animals.</premise>  <claim>It doesn't make it a better of worse life - it's just existing.</claim>

<claim>That's the other choice - accepting that animals are less than humans.  </claim>

&gt;a chicken is just a chicken

<claim>A chicken feels pain and suffering and does not want to feel those things as much as we do.</claim>


&gt;But it's not like a wild turkey sits on it's deathbed and thinks fondly of those days gone by, when it roamed free and raised its baby turkeys. No, it thinks more "food? sex? food?".

<claim>My sister is severely mentally disabled and most likely doesn't have the capacity to think fondly of days gone by on her death bed either.</claim> <premise>Does intelligence really make much of a difference when it comes to the ethics of whether we can kill them without moral concern?</premise>

<claim>I still don't see any good argument for how animals are 'less' than humans (beyond our own obvious bias).</claim>

<premise>How does a chicken "want" anything?</premise>  <claim>It is completely incapable of developing a though like, "Today would REALLY suck if that damn fox bites me again".</claim>

<claim>Yes, intelligence matters.</claim>  <premise>If not, we wouldn't allow brain-dead people to be unplugged.</premise>

<claim>Self-awareness puts one in a separate category than an animal.</claim>

But, regardless, <claim>I'm not trying to convince you not to care about animals</claim>, but that <claim>a rational person could come to the decision that those without higher cognition or self-awareness aren't equal.</claim>

<claim>Self awareness isn't a human-exclusive trait</claim> - <premise>dolphins, apes and elephants have been proven to possess it</premise>.

<premise>Regardless of self-awareness</premise>, <claim>the ability to suffer is what I regard as being more important to an individual.</claim>

<reply id="cnfculi" author="garnteller">
<claim>That may be what YOU consider, but that's not what others consider</claim>, which is why <claim>they can validly reach different conclusions.</claim>

<claim>And "suffer" needs more definition to discuss whether it's something animals can do.</claim>
